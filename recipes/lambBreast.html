   <h4>Description</h4>
   <p>Although there isnâ€™t an awful lot of meat on this particular cut, it is fatty and the inherent
        richness should leave you feeling sated without being overly full. As the lamb roasts it will
         release its moisture into the bed of chickpeas waiting expectantly below. The result is
          some of the tastiest pulses you will ever chow down. 
   </p>
   <p>A single piece of lamb breast should easily serve three-four people, depending on how long it has
        been since they last ate and whether or not they are the sort of friends happy to be fobbed off
         with extra pulses and veg instead of meat. Thought not. The recipe below is for two.</p>
