    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Simple, creamy clam chowder loaded with potatoes and bacon.
         Starting with a dry soup mix and half-and-half makes the recipe super easy.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>     
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pund bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>5 unpeeled potatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 oz) cans chopped clams</li>
        <li>2 (1.8 oz) packages dry leek soup mix</li>
        <li>1 quart half-and-half</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat,
             stirring occasionally, until crisped and browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving the drippings in the pot.
             Set the bacon aside.</li>
        <li>Stir the potatoes and carrots into the bacon fat. Season with salt and
             pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Pour the juice from the clams into the pot, and add enough water to
             just cover the potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low,
              cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently stir the leek soup mix into the potatoes until no lumps of soup remain.</li>
        <li>Stir in the clams, reserved bacon, and half-and-half cream. Cook and stir until
             the chowder returns to a simmer and thickens, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
